# Notes
- Maybe the `/tmp` might be too small to install Tensorflow directly. Workaround
  with `export TMPDIR=/path/to/manual/tmp/dir`
- "AttributeError: module 'os' has no attribute 'startfile" when downloading
  training data (seems to be a Linux issue)
- Classification always as "Smile" (or another constant category)
- not all images can be loaded (issue with `neutral/._R7bHOIpAxC.png`)
